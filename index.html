    <div id="essayTextBox" class="hidden-textbox">
        <p>“It matters what stories make worlds, what worlds make stories.”</p>
        <p>Myths are stories; considered and condensed, with details and perspectives omitted by a mythmaker.
            The ability of myth as a tool is that it can distort and change what an image or phrase signifies; 
            erasing complexities of human actions and creating worlds without contradiction. 
            This power to erase meaning is Roland Barthes’ motive for labelling myth as dangerous. </p>
    </div>

    <div id="essayTextBox2" class="hidden-textbox">
        <p>The example Barthes uses to demonstrate myths ability to hijack and distort the
             meaning of an image or phrase is presented in Myth Today.  
             The reader is presented a description of a French propaganda poster depicting a black soldier from a French colony
              giving a French salute. The intention of this propaganda is to claim there is unity across the French colonies. 
              With a semiological deconstruction of this image we can identify that the signifier is a black soldier, 
              the signified is French patriotism and the sign is the myth that there is unity across the French colonies. 
              Our unease with myth lies in the fact that in reading the posters mythic metalanguage this image as a 
              consequence of human actions and the related histories of trauma and colonisation are erased.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="essayTextBox3" class="hidden-textbox">
        <p>Roland Boer writes in The Robbery of Language that the crafting of “a world without contradiction” 
            is an undeniable acknowledgement of the undercurrent of oppositional perspectives erased in favour
             of a singular vision. Boer posits that within myth there are opportunities for using counter-myth
              as a means to resist the erasure of other perspectives.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="essayTextBox4" class="hidden-textbox">
        <p>Myth & Signification invites four artists to approach myth and counter-myth as 
            building blocks for crafting oppositional worlds to contest dominant discourses 
            and resist the homogenisation of perspective. resist the exploitation of land and 
            labour and resist the gendering of bodies. Astrid Elouise Bell is pulled towards the
             subjects for her triptych of paintings, and her considered practice of rummaging and
              reflection studies subjects with their own myths. Bell tbh employs painting as a tool for
               expanding the myth of each subject in a new direction, multiplying their mythology with each brushstroke. 
               Sydney Jarrett’s work also engages with similar ideas of  furthering mythologies. Jarrett’s installation 
               references Jordy Rosenberg’s Confession of the Fox and explores how one can trace the creation of myth 
               through archival histories while also extending upon stories that can serve as vehicles for truth. 
               Harrison Rae’s textiles and found objects continues his research into the myth of John Busby. Rae’s 
               work contests the quiet reverence placed upon Busby and the erasure of what was forced upon prisoners 
               and labourers working on Busby’s Bore - a waterway under Oxford Street connecting Centennial Park to Hyde Park. 
               Finally the video work by Nic Narapiromkwan Foo documents the artist praying at the site of Kits on River Road. 
               The documentation is a means to consolidate the demolished restaurant as its own myth and serves as a reminder 
               of myths’ relationship with ritual and memory.</p>

           <p>Together these works craft their own world of contradiction through counter myth. A world resisting the homogenisation of perspectives, the gendering of bodies, and the exploitation of land and labour.
